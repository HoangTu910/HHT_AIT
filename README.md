### Frontend setup (React + Vite + Tailwind)
Modify only App.jsx and pages folder when working with frontend
1. Install dependencies
```bash
$ npm i name_package
```
2. Build Frontend
```bash
$ npm run dev
```

**App.jsx Configuration**: 
* Add path by using path="/path_name" and element={<element_name/>}></Route>
* Everytime want to create a new path (API) just add another <Route> inside <Routes>

**Pages Folder**:
* element_name in App.jsx depend on .jsx file in pages
* If want to add new path, create new .jsx file and config html like login.jsx
* If copy a template on Tailwind rememeber to rename the *function* and *export default* 

**Query?**:
